Disordered MERA

This is the code used to produce the paper "Entanglement renormalization for disordered systems" by Andrew M. Goldsborough and Glen Evenbly, Phys. Rev. B 96, 155136. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.155136

Additional functions required to run the scripts here are:

ncon: R. N. C. Pfeifer, G. Evenbly, S. Singh, G. Vidal, arXiv:1402.0939. http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0939

netcon: R. N. C. Pfeifer, J. Haegeman, F. Verstraete, arXiv:1304.6112. http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6112

Both of which can be downloaded by selecting "other formats" and "download source" on arXiv.
